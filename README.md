# CS9860
- investigated different models - no real difference due to sequential layers
- investigate different style and content layers next, also different amount of style layers
- try with different types of data, swap style and content pictures around

- future: cycleGAN

# training sets:
## different models (also no difference)
vgg16,19, squeezenet, alexnet..
## different epochs
2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200?
## different content layers (even though they make no difference)
1, 5, 10, 12345,
## different level of style layers
1,2,3,4,5,6,7
## different amount of style layers
1234567,123456,345,4
